# Data-Integration-and-Reshaping

For this assessment, it is required to write Python code to integrate several datasets into one single schema and find and fix possible problems in the data.

Also, the effect of different normalization/transformation on certain attributes and observe and explain their effect assuming we want to develop a linear model to predict the
“price” using “Distance_to_sc”, “travel_min_to_CBD”, and “Distance_to_hospital” attributes are studied. The linear regression assumptions that you need to study in this task are: Normality
and Linearity.
